--INTRODUCTION--------------------------------------------------------
This Vision Document applies to the Mitchell's Homemade Ice Cream Cloud-Based Manager system, called MitchCloud. This new infrastructure cloud-based system will support the existing system along with any future expansions. 
The MitchCloud system will introduce full support for shopping over the internet, cart checkout, payment, and delivery or store pickup of Mitchell's Ice Cream. A server-client model architecture is used where clients can communicate with MitchCloud via a website, point-of-sale, or an app. The system will serve all system users including customers, employees, and all parties that may require access to the system.

--POSITIONING---------------------------------------------------------
-Business Opportunity-
This project will be overhauling the existing point-of-sale system and introducing it to an online system that allows all users access through internet enabled devices. Although updated, the current traditional style of service will still be applicable for customers who choose to utilize it.
The current system is outdated and lacks new age services that customers are becoming accustomed to. Also, the current system only provides access to services while in store. The new system will provide access on and off site for many different clients through the internet.

-Problem Statement-
The outdated, traditional interaction of purchasing ice cream is slow and inefficient. This leads to lower sales and potentially dissatisfied customers and employees. A successful solution would improve the brand of Mitchell's Ice Cream, provide an easy to use service for employees and customers, and attract new customers to the store.

-Product Position Statement-
This system is for Mitchell's Ice Cream customers, store clerks, managers and system administrators. It is intended for any person who conducts business with, works for, or provides services for Mitchell's Ice Cream. The MitchCloud system is a tool that enables online services for product purchasing, checking out, sales processing, and employee & store data. Unlike the current system, which only provides point-of-sale services and system access in-store. This system provides online sales services for any customer at any store location. It provides online services for managers and employees accessable from anywhere through the internet.

-Key Stakeholder Goals-
<goal>Online Purchasing
<priority>High 
<problems/concerns>Purchasing products is a slow and inefficient process.
<current solution>All transactions must occur at a physical location, but does not address the issue.

<goal>Online System Access
<priority>High
<problems/concerns>Accessing and modifying store information (such as employee data) is unavailable off-site.
<current solution>All information must be retrieved from inside the store through an administrator's login. This does not address the issue.
