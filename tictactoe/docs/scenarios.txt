~Move has successfully been executed and the next player is up

A1. The game engine ends the game and terminates.
A2. The user's input is skipped and they are given another chance to pick a spot.
A3. The user is notified that that space is occupied and given another chance to choose a spot.
A4. The game determines whether there was a win or a tie and adds to the score tracker. Winner is displayed on screen and new round starts.
A5. The player holding the win streak is asked whether they would like to cash out or continue on to win more money. Computer always cashes out.
    If cash out is chosen, the game awards the player with credits and their streak is reset. If continue is chosen, the player is not awarded
	credits and their streak continues to be tracked.
A6. The player has reached the maximum amount of credits and automatically wins. Winner displayed and fresh game starts.
